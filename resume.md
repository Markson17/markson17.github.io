##Projects
**Learning Log**
I built a Learning Log web application with Django, a web framework for Python. The purpose of this application is to allow users to create an account and log in to access their own learning log, where they can create new topics and add entries to each topic. Entries can be viewed individually and edited or deleted as needed. The website's simple and responsive user interface makes it easy to navigate and use. This application was created as a project to demonstrate an understanding of Django's core concepts. 

**Technologies Used**
HTML, CSS, Python(Django Framework), Bootstrap
